### Appium with c# .net core  

Here are the steps to use appium with .net core to run automated tests in mobile devices (phisical and virtualized devices) 

In this sample test, the following versions of the following frameworks are required:

* NodeJs (v 12.14.1)
* npm (v 6.13.4)
* appium (v 1.17.0)

Android setup: 

* Android emulator (v 30.0.0 (build_id: 6203977))
* Android API v 29
* Avd Nexus 5 ( x86 image based )
* Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41

* . NET Setup
* . NET CORE v 3.1
* Appium.WebDriver -Version 4.1.1

First of all, the building of the android emulator is required. I build the Nexus 5 emulator, using a x86 based image system, and the following step was the appium instalation. 
I've got some issues using appium desktop (version 1.15), and the solution for that isues was use the npm based install. The appium install retrieves the version 1.17, and i've got no errors on this version.
After the emulator build, and the appium install, i prepared the test automation environment: i've tested the youtube apk, witch the following appium capabilities: 

```json
{
  "platform": "Android", 
  "platformVersion": "10", 
  "automationName": "UIAutomator2", 
  "deviceName": "Nexus_5X_API_29_x86", 
  "uiautomator2ServerInstallTimeout" : 80000, 
  "uiautomator2ServerLaunchTimeout" : 80000, 
  "adbExecTimeout" : 80000, 
  "appActivity" : "com.google.android.apps.youtube.app. WatchWhileActivity", 
  "app" : "\\path\\to\\some\\dir\\YouTube.apk", 
  "noSign" : true
}

``` 
Then i've cloned the code available in [this repo](https://github.com/weslleyluiz/AppiumTest) , and started the appium server, and run the tests. The expected behaviour is: Check if the home button appears; Check if the text on the button is the 'Home' string; and print after that checks, and assert if the text was the expected string.
